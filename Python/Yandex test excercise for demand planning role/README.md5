This is a solution for Yandex's test excercise in python.

The task:

Rajesh Kuthrapali's family has a strange structure.
Each man has a son first, then a daughter is born. For women the pattern is inversed: a daughter is born first, a son is second.
Knowing that, Rajesh wants to predict the gender of the K-th child in the N-th offspring generation.
You should write a program for this purpose.

       M      1st generation
      / \
    M     F   2nd generation
   / \   / \
  M   F F   M
        |
        3rd child in the 3rd generation

________

Solution explained below
_____________________
Files description:

The folder contains 2 files rajesh.py and rajesh_console.py.

rajesh.py
		- file contains python rajesh_tree class.

rajesh_console.py
		- file contains procedure for interactive search
		of the gender of k-th descendand of Rajesh in n-th generation
		Default gender of Rajesh is set to be Male.
		Run the code in a python interpreter and follow the instructions.
		Works only if rajesh.py located in the same folder
___

Features of rajesh_tree class:

1. Default gender of Rajesh is set to be "M" for Male.
You can set up Rajesh's gender by providing r_gender to the class's params.
r_gender must be either "M" or "F".

Example:
r_male = rajesh_tree()
r_female = rajesh_tree("F")

2. Use rajesh_tree().c_search(n, k) for *cyclical* search of
a k-th descendant's gender in n-th genration

3. Use rajesh_tree().r_search(n, k) for *recursive* search of
a k-th descendant's gender in n-th genration

NB! Recursive search might not finish due to recursion limit
if n is too high. It was created for exploration purposes only.
